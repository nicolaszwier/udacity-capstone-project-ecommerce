# Ecommerce Fullstack Project
 This is the final project from Udacity Full-Stack Developer nanodegree.
 The project is a simple ecommerce  where you can see a list of all products os by category in the initial page.
 It's possible to signin and add products to your cart, see the cart products, delete a product and "create a order" with the products you have selected. In the "create a order", I mean it's a fake order who won't be persist in the database.
